This folder(/Data) is for local use only. Put all your data files in /Data locally and update this README with the file/folder name, description, and link, so others in the group can download the datasets locally as well. 
Again the Data folder is already in git ignore and the Readme has been added before. So all you have to do is download data in this foler only and make sure to keep the list updates.
